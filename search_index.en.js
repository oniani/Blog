programming\nmethodology called functional programming. Throughout the blogpost, I will\noccasionally use the purely functional programming language Haskell as well\nas an imperative-style programming language Python. There is also a few lines\nof C++. I will be assuming the knowledge of basic programming concepts such as\nvariable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, functions,\nloops, and recursion.\nIt is important to note that the blogpost is just an introduction to the\nparadigms in functional programming and does not cover any of them in great\ndetail.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Functional Programming?\nClasses VS Functions\nNatural Results\nMath, Sets, and Haskell\nState Changes and Functional Programming\nControl Flow\n\n1. Functional Languages Are Declarative\n2. Functional Programming And Lambda Calculus\n3. Getting Rid of Loops\n\n\nPurely Functional Languages\nConclusion\nHow to Get Started with Functional Programming?\n\n\n\nWhat is Functional Programming?\n\nAs mentioned above, functional programming is just an approach to programming.\nParticularly, it refers to programming using functions, hence the name\nfunctional programming. To better understand what it means for a programming\nlanguage to be functional, let's make a short side-by-side comparison of\nfunctional and, wildly popular, imperative style of programming languages and\nthen discuss the differences in detail.\nImperative languageFunctional language\nClasses and/or structures are the first-class objectsFunctions are the first-class objects\nState changes are importantState changes are limited (or non-existent)\nThe primary control flows include loops, conditionals, and functionsThe primary control flows are function calls and recursion\n\nClasses VS Functions\nThe first comparison shows that, generally speaking, in the imperative\nlanguages (Python, Java, Lua, Nim etc.), variables (instances of classes\nand/or structures) dominate over all other objects. Thus, imperative paradigm\nmakes a clear distinction between variables and functions. On the other hand,\nin functional programming languages, functions are the first-class citizens\nmaking virtually everything else rank below them.\nImperative programming languages treat variables as data while functions are\ngenerally used just to manipulate variables. When programming in a functional\nlanguage, we say that functions are very similar to variables. In fact, we say\nthat they are no different than variables as they not only manipulate the data,\nbut also represent the data themselves. Thus, in the functional world, we say\nthat the piece of code like a function is also data.\nI will give you a concise proof of why functions are data. Remember the table\nrepresentations of functions you've learned at some point in the elementary\nschool? That's the proof! Any function can be represented as a table of values.\nFor instance, consider a function $f(x) = 2x$. The following will be a table\nrepresentation of the function.\n$x$$f(x)$\n00\n12\n24\n36\n48\n510\n612\n......\n\nLooks more like data? That's because it is the data! We have effectively\ngenerated a 2-column table where each of the cells has a certain value.\nReminds of SQL tables or pandas data frames?\nNatural Results\nBecause functions are so important, there are natural results and outcomes\nwhich are shared among most of functional languages.\nLet's write a Haskell function to find the factorial of a positive integer.\n-- | A function to find the factorial of a positive integer\nfactorial x = product [1..x]  -- easy as that\n\nThe function builds a list of integers from 1 up to x and then calculates\nthe product of these elements. This way we effectively get a product\n$1 \\times 2 \\times 3 .. \\times \\ x$ which is the same as $x!$.\nSince we now have a function, we can call it with the actual parameters!\nprint (factorial 1)  -- prints out 1\nprint (factorial 6)  -- prints out 720\nprint (factorial 9)  -- prints out 362880\n\nAs we see, something that in imperative languages would need importing modules,\nfor loops or while loops can be writte as a one-liner in Haskell. This is one\nof the outcomes of obsession over functions. Most functional languages have a\nrich pool of predefined functions that help manipulate data. In the example\nabove, we also see a very interesting notation. Namely, [1..x] which builds\nup a list of integers from 1 up to $x$ ($x$ must also be an integer such that\n$x \\geq 1$). Thus, another outcome is that data structures and collections can\nbe created very easily, usually just in a single line of code, leaving more\ntime for the programmer to deal with functions and the logic. These are some\nof the reasons why functional languages are so concise.\nMath, Sets, and Haskell\nNotice that in the factorial function above, I excluded the case when the\nfunction is called with $0$ ($0! = 1$). It was done on purpose so that now\nwe are able to add some other notation and explain the whole function in\ndetail. Below is a better and more complete version of the function.\n-- | A function to find the factorial of a number\nfactorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer\nfactorial 0 = 1\nfactorial x = product [1..x]\n\n:: - prompts that it is a function declaration\nInteger - type that can hold any number no matter how big, up to the limit of\nthe machine's memory (so yes, this means you never have arithmetic overflows).\n-&gt; - tells either what is the type of the next formal parameter or what is\nthe type of the output\nLooks similar to something you have seen before? If you have taken any\nundergraduate math class, there is a big chance that you've encountered\nthe following notation:\n$$f : A \\rightarrow B : x \\mapsto y$$\nThe notation above describes/defines a simple function that takes an input\nfrom set $A$ and maps it to the output in the set $B$.\nHere is the complete definition of the factorial function that we saw above:\n$$f : \\mathbb{Z}^+\\cup {0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^+ : x \\mapsto x!$$\nHaskell defines it the similar manner.\nfactorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer says that factorial\nis a function that takes an element from the set of integers and maps it to\nsome other element in the set of integers. As opposed to math, however, Haskell\ndoes not use $\\mapsto$ notation and instead has the statements below it.\nfactorial 0 = 1\nfactorial x = product [1..x]\n\nThe code above is equivalent to saying that if the element is 0, map it to 1\nand in all other cases, map it to the product from 1 up to the element.\nState Changes and Functional Programming\nFunctional languages have a limited notion of state and typically, avoid the\nshared mutable state at any cost. Purely (see Purely Functional Languages)\nfunctional languages like Haskell, do not have any state at all. Since there\nare no changes in state, there are no variables. Instead, functional languages\noffer functions and immutable variables.\nTo make it clear, let's look at two examples below. One is from Python and the\nother is from Haskell.\nPython example\n# Define a variable 'my_number' and assign it to 3\nmy_number = 3\n\n# Increment the variable 'my_number' by 1 and reassign it to the result\nmy_number += 1\n\nprint(my_number)  # Prints out 4\n\nLet's repeat the same steps in Haskell.\nmyNumber = 3    -- Define a variable 'myNumber' and assign it to 3\nmyNumber += 1   -- Haskell gags here (infinite loop)\n\nprint myNumber  -- This statement is not reachable\n\nLooking at the code above, you might have already noticed that Haskell\ndoes not allow us to change the state of the program. Now you might be\nwondering how could one increment variables.\nHere is a short answer:\nmyNumber = 3                  -- Define a variable 'myNumber' and assign it to 3\nmyOtherNumber = myNumber + 1  -- Define a variable 'myOtherNumber' and assign it to 'myNumber'\nmyNumber = myOtherNumber      -- Redefine 'myNumber' and set it to 'myOtherNumber'\nprint myNumber                -- Prints out 4\n\nLonger and better answer\n\nYou do not really need such increments or decrements in functional programming\nlanguages. You can easily overcome this hindrance through functions and\nrecursion. Therefore, instead of mutating objects, we use recursion to\ngradually get to the target.\nHere is the example of how one could translate a well-known accumulator pattern\nfrom Python to Haskell.\nHere is a classic Python accumulator pattern.\n# An accumulator pattern approach for finding\n# the sum of the first 100 positive integers.\n\ntotal = 0\nfor integer in range(1, 100):\n    total += integer\n\nprint(total)  # Prints out 5050\n\nHere is what it looks like in Haskell.\naccumulator 1 = 1                        -- The base case for the recursion\naccumulator x = x + accumulator (x - 1)  -- The recursive case\n\n\nmain = print (accumulator 100)  -- Prints out 5050\n\nIn the code excerpt above, we did not use any loops. In fact, we could not use\nany loops because functional languages do not support loops. Instead, we\ndefined a function, used the recursion and calculated the sum of the values\nthrough function calls.\nSide note\nIn this particular case, we do not even need to implement the recursive\naccumulator pattern. All we need to do is use the already predefined sum\nfunction and so-called texas range list notation that we have already\nseen ([1..x]).\nprint (sum [1..100])  -- Prints out 5050\nControl Flow\nAs we have already seen, there are no for loops or while loops in functional\nprogramming languages and there are good reasons why. Let's list a few of them\nand continue our discussion by elaborating on those reasons.\n\nFunctional languages are declarative.\nMost of functional languages are heavily influenced by lambda calculus.\nIf you were to implement a functional programming language,\nyou would yourself get rid of loops.\n\n1. Functional Languages Are Declarative\nFor those who are new to the idea of declarative languages, let's first\ndiscuss what it means for a language to be declarative. Here is a simple\ndefinition:\n\nDeclarative programming is a method to abstract away the control flow for\nlogic required for performing an action, and instead involves stating what\nthe task or desired outcome is.\n\nThe examples of declarative languages are SQL, Haskell, Prolog etc.\nExample 1: Consider the SQL querying language. In SQL, one doesn't\ndescribe what how to get the data. One just tells SQL what data is needed,\nand SQL engine figures out the best way to get it.\nExample 2: A better example might be comparing two implementations\nof a simple function. Let's implement them in both Python and Haskell.\nThe function takes a list of integers and returns the sum of odd integers in it.\ndef odd_sum(list_of_integers):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of all odd integers in the list.\"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for integer in list_of_integers:\n        if integer % 2 == 1:\n            total += integer\n    return total\n\n\nprint(odd_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Prints out 9\n\nLet's do a shallow analysis of the odd_sum function. As seen above, it\nstarts by declaring a variable total which is initially set to 0. Then,\nwe iterate over the list and through each iteration, we check if the\ninteger is odd and if it is, we add it to total. In the end, we return\nthe total variable.\nNow, that we have analyzed the function a bit, notice that in the for\nloop, through each iteration, we are giving Python directions when to\nadd the integer to total (only if it is odd). Thus, we tell Python what\nto do step-by-step. This is an important characteristic that distinguishes\nnon-declarative languages from declarative ones.\nLet's now look at the Haskell example.\noddSum x = sum (filter odd x)\n\nmain = print (oddSum [1,2,3,4,5])  -- Prints out 9\n\nNotice what we did here. First we defined a function oddSum which takes\na list. Then we used the function filter (happened to be predefined) in\nconjunction with another predefined function odd (returns true if the value\nis odd an false otherwise) to get the list of odd integers. Finally, we summed\nup all the odd integers and got the result.\nSee the difference? In Python, we used a for loop and through each iteration,\nwe told Python whether to add the integer it to total or not. In Haskell,\nhowever, we gave a whole list to the function and told it to just remove\nall of the even integers from the list and then to sum up the rest (if you\neliminate all the even integers, you are obviously left with all the odd\nintegers). In other words, in the Haskell example, we do not care how the\nfunctions sum and filter work internally, we only care about the fact that\nthey do their job - sum up the odd numbers in the list and return the value.\n2. Functional Programming And Lambda Calculus\n\nLambda calculus (also written as $\\lambda$-calculus) is a branch of mathematics\nwhich was developed by Alonzo Church\nin the 1930s. It is a formal system for expressing computation and an alternative\nto what's called Turing machine which\nwas introduced by Alan Turing.\nTuring machines involve loops and other non-declarative approaches (Turing machines\nare the inspiration for programming languages like Java, Python, etc).\nA few years later, Church and Turing collaboratively wrote a paper which is now\nknow as the computability thesis\nand proved that all the computation that was done using Turing machines could\neffectively be done in lambda calculus as well. Hence, simply put, lambda calculus\nhas the power equivalent to that of Turing machines. Not too long after, people\ndecided to base programming languages on the ideas in lambda calculus (it was\njust as powerful as Turing machines so why not?!). This led to shared characteristics\namong functional languages such as lack of loops. Virtually all functional\nprogramming languages have no loops because lambda calculus has no loops.\nOne could certainly add loops, but they would have been redundant. Instead,\nfunctional languages use a mathematical idea of recursion. This is the part\nof the reason why loops are not that appreciated in the functional world.\n3. Getting Rid of Loops\n\nDespite the fact that sometimes they are very useful, loops must not be a part\nof a functional programming language. There are several reasons for this.\n\nLoops promote and advocate the idea of \"imperativeness\" (prompting the language what to do).\nLoops usually involve mutating values which is, once again, against functional virtues.\nEven if we did not use it imperatively and not mutate values, it would create unnecessary\nredundance in a language with the emphasis on recursion (which is just as powerful as a\nregular loop!)\n\nPurely Functional Languages\nYou might have seen word pure in the beginning of the blogpost where I\nmentioned that Haskell is purely functional programming language. However, I\nnever defined what it means for a functional language to be pure. So let's do\nit now!\nThose who read the Math, Sets, and Haskell, remember\nthe math notation for functions? I will use them to take the mystery out of\nthis concept of being pure!\nSuppose we have a function $f : \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$. Then by\njust looking at the function, we see that it takes an input from a set of\nintegers and its output is also in the set of integers. In other words,\nfunction $f$ cannot take inputs like -1.9, 0.2, 12.7 etc. as well as it cannot\ngive an output like 12.6, 71.9, -9.1 etc. Its input(s) and output(s) could\nonly be integers.\nNow, let's actually make this dull function $f$ do something. Consider the\nfunction $f : \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} : x \\mapsto 2x$. Thus, we have\na function which does a fairly straightforward thing: takes an integer and maps\nit to twice its value (which will also be an integer). Let's now look at the\nHaskell implementation of this function\n-- | A function that takes an input and outputs twice its value\nf :: Integer -&gt; Integer\nf x = 2 * x\n\nThe function above says that the input (corresponds to the Integer before the\narrow) is always an integer and the output (corresponds to the integer after\nthe arrow) is also an integer. Hence, we always know what type is the input\nand what type is the output. In fact, we also know that the if we call a\nfunction with say 5, we will always get the same result. Namely, f 5 = 10.\nHence, we got that input(s) and output(s) are always integers and the function\ncalled with same actual parameters always return the same value! This is what\nmakes Haskell a purely functional language. At any given point in time, we\nalways know what is the type of input and what is type of output. Besides,\nwe know that the function called with the same actual parameter(s), always\nreturns the same value. Such functions virtually never produce side effects\nsince we already know what to expect for a given input. Such functions are\ncalled pure!\nTo further demystify this idea, let's look at the following piece of code\nfrom a C++ programming language.\n/*\n * An example of a function that is pretending to be pure.\n *\n */\n\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint not_so_pure_function(int value) {\n    return value + rand() % 3;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Returns: \" &lt;&lt; not_so_pure_function(7) &lt;&lt; endl;  // Prints out 8\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Returns: \" &lt;&lt; not_so_pure_function(7) &lt;&lt; endl;  // Prints out 8\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Returns: \" &lt;&lt; not_so_pure_function(7) &lt;&lt; endl;  // Prints out 7\n}\n\nHere, we defined a function that takes an integer input and it seems like the\noutput is also an integer. We now might be lured into thinking that function\nnot_so_pure_function gives the same output for the same input, but that is\nclearly not the case here (that is why it's called not_so_pure_function).\nLet's take a closer look at what the function does. It takes an integer value\nand returns the value plus some random number which is 0, 1 or 2. When we first\ncalled the function with the actual parameter 7, we got 8 as an output. The\nsecond time, we got 8 again. The third time however, we got 7. Hence, for the\nthird time, the output was not the same. Therefore, the function is not pure.\nYou now might wondering why I could not do the same trick in Haskell. In fact,\nI certainly can. However, in Haskell, such function would not have a type Int.\nIt would have a type IO Int. IO is usually associated with file input / output\nand it is reasonable that it is associated with functions that are not always\n\"truthful\" as File I/O could in fact be one of the nastiest experiences for a\nprogrammer. So many things can go wrong! (e.g., writing to a file which was\ndeleted, reading from a file on a USB which was ejected, writing a file that\nwas moved to some other directory etc). Thus, when we deal with uncertainty\n(which usually comes with side effects), Haskell warns us by using the IO\nnotation.\nHere is how not_so_pure_function could be made pure in Haskell.\n{-\nExample of a function that if called with the same argument,\ndoes not always return the same result.\n-}\n\nimport System.Random (randomRIO)\n\n\npurifiedFunction :: Int -&gt; IO Int\npurifiedFunction value = do\n    randomValue &lt;- randomRIO (0,2)\n    return (value + randomValue)\n\n\nmain = do\n    x &lt;- purifiedFunction 7\n    print x                  -- Prints out 9\n    x &lt;- purifiedFunction 7\n    print x                  -- Prints out 7\n    x &lt;- purifiedFunction 7\n    print x                  -- Prints out 9\n\nLook at the Haskell code above. You can disregard all the notational fluff.\nJust look at the return type of the function purifiedFunction. It is IO Int!\nIn other words, Haskell informs us that the function might have side effects.\nThis is exactly why Haskell is pure.\nFinally, we can have sort of a definition of a pure functional language.\nNOTE: Pure might mean a completely different\nthing in non-functional languages.\n\nA functional language is pure if and only if the user is informed of all\nthe side effects in a language or there are no side effects at all.\n\nActually, Haskell did not allow random values back in 1990s when its development\nwas first launched. Because of this, Haskell was considered useless for all\npractical purposes. Eventually, developers and the Haskell committee decided\nto change the direction of Haskell. In lieu of getting rid of all the side\neffects, they decided to control the side effects and created a more \"regulated\"\nprogramming environment.\nConclusion\nFunctional programming languages are different from imperative ones. Most of\nthem are based on ideas in lambda calculus. Functional languages are the proper\nsubset of declarative languages. There are no loops and recursion is used instead.\nChanges in state are non-existent and therefore, all the variables are immutable.\nFunctional languages have a bunch of predefined functions to make it easy for a\nprogrammer to solve problems. Most of functional languages are also very concise\nminimizing the time spent on coding and leaving more time for the logic.\nPure functional languages are the proper subset of functional languages.\nPurely functional languages inform the user about the side effects in advance.\n\n\n\nHow to Get Started with Functional Programming?\n\nThere are a lot of functional languages. You will obviously have to decide\nwhich one to learn first. My recommendation would be learning Haskell.\nIt is a purely functional programming language which has most of (if not all)\nthe functional ideas in it. Besides, SPJ (Simon Payton Jones)\ndedicates most of his time on extending the language and adding new features\nto it. So if there is something new and interesting in the world of functional\nprogramming, Haskell will probably get it (and probably sooner than other\nfunctional or imperative languages).\nAfter learning one functional language, it is fairly easy (\"easy\" is relative,\nbut being familiar with one functional language automatically makes you\nsomewhat familiar with others) to transition to the other. Hence, once you have\na good grasp of functional ideas in Haskell, you can then move to languages\nlike Clojure, Scheme, F# etc.\nTo get started, visit the Haskell documentation\npage which is full of various educational resources.\n","id":"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/the-essence-of-programming-functional-approach/","title":"The Essence of Programming - Functional Approach"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/the-essence-of-programming-functional-approach/":{"body":2051,"title":4}},"length":2}};
