A few words concerning the privacy on the web.

<!-- more -->

NOTE: This blogpost will get occasional updates, when needed.

Here are my recommendations for the web privacy.

- Lightweight Privacy: Emphasis on Usability and Speed

  - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) as the default browser

    - [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/) for password management
    - [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/) as the default search engine
    - [Privacy Possum](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-possum/) to reduce and falsify data gathered by trackers
    - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) to block ads (and other junk)

  - [Signal](https://signal.org/) as a messenger
  - [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) for group chats and collaborations

- Heavier Privacy: Emphasis on Privacy
  - Use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)

* Super Advanced Privacy: Stronger Emphasis on Privacy
  - Do not use the web
