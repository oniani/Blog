A few words concerning the privacy on the web.

NOTE: The blogpost will get occasional updates, when needed.

Here are my recommendations for the web privacy.

- Lightweight Privacy: Emphasis on Usability and Speed

  - [Firefox](firefox) as the default browser

    - [Bitwarden](bitwarden) for password management
    - [DuckDuckGo](duckduckgo) as the default search engine
      - [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](duckduckgo_privacy_essentials) extension for better integration
    - [Privacy Possum](privacy_possum) to reduce and falsify data gathered by trackers
    - [uBlock Origin](ublock_origin) to block ads (and other junk)

  - [Signal](signal) as a messenger
  - [Riot](riot) for group chats and collaborations

- Heavier Privacy: Emphasis on Privacy
  - Use [Tor](tor)

* Super Advanced Privacy: Stronger Emphasis on Privacy
  - Do not use the web
