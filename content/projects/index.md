### Ongoing Projects

- A project that seeks to provide students a way to share their experiences
  abroad.
- A machine learning library using a reverse mode automatic differentiation.
- A build system (cross-platform rewrite of [b][b], with better parsing and
  more options).
- A tiny interpreted language written in Haskell (a significant portion of it
  is already written, so might consider porting it to Rust for speed).
